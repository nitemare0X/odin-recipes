		<h3>Hand pies and mini pies come out delightfully crisp and flaky in your air fryer. These delicious blueberry hand pies are quick and easy to make using prepared pie dough and pie filling. You only need 4 ingredients total!</h3>

		<p>A nice quick snack for the working class.</p>

		<p>One of the best choices for an afternoon snack.</p>

		<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (14.1 ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts</li>
			<li>Â½ (21 ounce) can blueberry pie filling</li>
			<li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon coarse sugar for sprinkling</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Directions:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Roll out each circle of pie dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut circles into the dough using a 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter to make 16 circles (8 from each dough round). If you don't have a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter, you can use the mouth of a large cup or wide-mouth jar.</li>
			<li>Moisten the edge of a circle with water, then add 2 tablespoons blueberry pie filling in the center (or however much can fit while still leaving the edges bare).</li>
			<li>Place another dough circle on top of the filling and pinch the edges of the two dough rounds together to seal. Use a fork to crimp the edges to secure them further. Add a slit in the top of the crust with a sharp knife. Repeat with the remaining dough circles until you have 8 round pies.</li>
			<li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place pies in the basket in a single layer (you may need to work in batches). Spray the tops of the pies with more cooking spray, and sprinkle the tops with coarse sugar.</li>
			<li>Cook in the air fryer until golden brown, about 9 minutes.</li>
		</ol>
